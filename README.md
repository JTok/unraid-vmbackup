*A beta version for an unRAID plugin is located [here](https://github.com/JTok/unraid.vmbackup "VM Backup plugin") and in Community Applications.*

Script for use with unRAID's CA User Scripts plugin. See [here](https://lime-technology.com/forums/topic/48286-plugin-ca-user-scripts/ "CA User Scripts") for more information.

Currently the script is in a relatively stable state, and most of the features have been implemented. I have tested them as well as I can, but I cannot guarantee they will work correctly for everyone, so be sure to test thoroughly on your system before depending on this script for backups. Please review the Change Log and To-Do List if you would like to know more.

## Important

The virtual disks attached to a single VM must have unique names regardless of their location since during the backup they will be placed into the same folder.
i.e. VM1 cannot have /mnt/diskX/vdisk1.img and /mnt/users/domains/VM1/vdisk1.img since the vdisks will overwrite the each other during the backup. However, VM1 and VM2 can both have a vdisk1.img since they will be backed up to different folders.

## Installation

- Add the script and description files to the CA User Scripts plugin. No other files are necessary to make the script work.

- Set the variables in the script file.

  - be sure to set enabled = "1" to ensure that the script will run.

  - to enable the script while parity check is running change line 4 from "noParity=true" to "noParity=false"

- Choose a schedule in the CA User Scripts plugin.

### Script options

- Choose a backup location.

- Choose to backup all VMs, or list specific VMs to be backed up.

  - If backup all VMs is enabled, the list of VMs to backup is used as an exclusion list instead.

- List specific vdisks to skip, if any.

- List specific vdisk extensions to skip, if any (iso listed by default).

- Option to use snapshots to backup VMs without shutting down.

  - be sure to install the qemu guest agent on VMs to enable quiescence, which will improve the integrity of backups.

  - the disk path in the VM config cannot be /mnt/user, but instead must be /mnt/cache or /mnt/diskX.

- Option to kill a VM that won't shutdown cleanly.

#### VM restart options

- Option to have VMs start after backup based on their previous state.

- Advanced: Option to have VMs start after successful backup regardless of previous state.

- Advanced: Option to have VMs start after failed backup regardless of previous state.

#### Backup retention options

- Choose the number of days to keep backups.

- Choose the number backups to keep.

#### Logging and notification options
